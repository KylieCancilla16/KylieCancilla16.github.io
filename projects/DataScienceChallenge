summary: "Competed in a Computer Vision Data Science Challenge with a team of interns"
---

Computer vision is one of the most innovative applications of artificial intelligence today. A key challenge in this field is accurately detecting and reconstructing objects that are partially hidden or occluded by their surroundings.  

During my Data Science Summer Institute internship at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, my team and I tackled the problem of amodal content completion for objects in video. We compared off-the-shelf model architectures with custom U-Net models, analyzing the trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy in computer vision tasks.
